## Description
Azure Lighthouse provides CompuNet delegated access to subscriptions in your Azure environment, facilitating project work and ongoing supportâ€”all while leaving your organization in control. Lighthouse eliminates the need to create administrator accounts for CompuNet engineers in your organization's Azure AD tenant and establishes a secure partner relationship, providing greater visibility of CompuNet's access and actions.

CompuNet strives to reduce risk through the principles of "just enough" and "just in time" access. CompuNet leverages Azure AD Privileged Identity Management to grant our engineers the minimum level of permissions required to support your environment and provide a secure method of temporarily elevating access when necessary.

Below you will find instructions for deploying Azure Lighthouse (it's simple!) as well as a list of authorizations, or role-based access control assignments that will be provided to CompuNet. As always, please reach out to us if you have any questions!

## Deployment Instructions
1. Click the _**Deploy to Azure**_ button above

2. Be sure to be signed in with an Azure AD account that has _Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write_ permissions (typically a user assigned to Owner role for the Azure subscription)

3. On the "Custom Deployment" page, select the appropriate subscription from the dropdown and then verify that the correct Region is populated
